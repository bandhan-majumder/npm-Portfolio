# NPM package for terminal portfolio
## This is a simple terminal porfolio type package which contains the information of Bandhan Majumder.
## I tried to add profile photo, I was successful locally, but npm does not support those image file types (.jpeg, .png). So I decided to remove that, I case you want to test with your photo locally, go to my github's 'main' branch and try it out...
## Support me by typing..
`npx bandhanz`
### If you also want to publish something like this of you, the resources are shared in github.. Thanks.
